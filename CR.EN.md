### **Abstract**
*Computational Realism* proposes a grand and logically self-consistent theoretical framework, aiming to depict the universe as an effective system operating according to underlying computational laws. It does not assert that the universe is ontologically "a" computer, but rather constructs a powerful model wherein the physical reality we know emerges as an inevitable consequence of a more fundamental set of computational axioms.

One of the theory's most subversive contributions lies in transforming the cornerstones of physics—such as the mass-energy relation E² = (m₀c²)² + (pc)²—from empirical axioms into a mathematical theorem necessarily derived from a philosophical principle of "perspective self-consistency." It introduces the "Time Share" (L_t) as the fundamental computational resource of the universe and, with this at its core, profoundly reconstructs the fundamental picture of physics:

*   **Emergence of Gravity**: Gravity is no longer a fundamental force but the necessary geometric effect formed at the macroscopic level due to the gradient created in the computational resource field when matter consumes "Time Shares" through its existence and activity. It is a cosmic-scale "resource scheduling."
*   **Emergence of Relativity**: Special and General Relativity are interpreted as a "systematic perceptual distortion" that is impossible for an internal observer to debunk. Because the observer's clock rate and measuring rod length both vary in concert with the local "Time Share" level, the speed of light they measure is necessarily constant, from which the complete relativistic spacetime emerges.
*   **Emergence of Mass**: The rest mass of a particle is no longer an intrinsic property but a macroscopic manifestation of the "topological complexity" of its underlying computational pattern. The mass of a particle is the continuous "cost" (measured by the L_t consumption rate) that the universe's "operating system" must pay to maintain its unique and stable computational pattern. This idea provides a novel framework for explaining the vast hierarchy of particle masses and predicts that the mass ratios between particles are, in principle, constants locked by geometry and rules, calculable from first principles.
*   **Computational Origin of Quantum Phenomena**: Quantum randomness originates from a deterministic underlying rule accessing a globally synchronized random number sequence. The mystery of quantum entanglement's "spooky action at a distance" is resolved as a form of "local computation under global synchronization": separated particles, by sharing the same global random number and acting according to their pre-"locked" intrinsic identities, independently compute perfectly correlated results.

Finally, the theory proposes a series of clear, testable predictions, such as a strict inverse relationship between the gravitational constant G and the dark energy density (cosmological constant Λ) (G ∝ 1/Λ), and fundamental particle mass ratios.

In summary, *Computational Realism* unifies gravity, relativity, mass, and even quantum mechanics on a common computational foundation, striving to transform physical laws from "what they are," which require explanation, to "why they must be so," as determined by first principles. It offers an ambitious and highly inspiring new perspective for understanding the origin and rules of our universe.

### **Chapter 1: The Ultimate Foundation of the Universe - Hardware and Ontological DNA**

This chapter defines the most fundamental, eternal, and immutable absolute properties of the universe, which are the source of all phenomena. These axioms are the unshakable cornerstones of this theory.

#### **Axiom 0 (Global Randomness Field)**
There exists a one-dimensional, infinitely long, and absolutely immutable global random number sequence R(τ). This sequence is the "ontological DNA" of the universe, existing independently of space. At every sub-Planck time step τ, every computational node in the universe accesses the same, identical random value R(τ).

#### **Axiom 1 (Discrete Computational Grid)**
The ultimate foundation of the universe is a three-dimensional, discrete, static, sub-Planck scale computational grid. It is the logical space that hosts all computations and is the final definition of the concept of "location." Because its length is far smaller than the Planck scale, the grid exhibits macroscopic properties at the Planck scale.

#### **Axiom 2 (Absolute System Clock)**
There exists a globally synchronized system clock that drives the computation of all nodes in the universe at a fixed period, Δτ_system (sub-Planck time). This ensures the synchronized access to R(τ) and the orderly evolution of the universe, providing an absolute ontological basis for "simultaneity."

#### **Axiom 3 (Computational Rules and Units)**
In this theoretical framework, we define the fundamental particles of the Standard Model as the minimum functional units for computation by the universe's "operating system." Each particle possesses a fixed type label L, an evolution time t, and a unique, non-spontaneously changing identity key K, denoted as A{L,t,K}. These attributes affect the particle's interaction with other particles, serving as core parameters for the computational rule F, such that Outcome = F(A, B, ..., R(τ)) directly affects A's internal attributes {L,t,K} and its external attributes.

*   **3.1 Relativity of Particle Definition:** This definition is our simplification of the computational universe. Because the division between internal and external is relative, a particle (a relationship) is actually a collection of smaller internal relationships. However, to study this complex pattern in a layered manner, we give a label to a fundamental particle, which is to name the pattern it presents. Since a particle (pattern) is always at a forward-evolving point in time, we define this as t. Decay is the dissolution of the internal relationships of a particle (relational pattern), becoming several independent patterns and energy. This process is influenced by the temporal mechanism we discuss.
*   **3.2 Definition of Particle Complexity:** Complexity is the definition of a particle's internal relationships, i.e., its mass. Its ultimate origin lies in topological structural complexity, with its value defined on the non-negative integers. However, in the main body of our paper, we will continue to use SI units.

#### **Axiom 4 (Principle of Relative Reality Definition)**
The mathematical form of the physical laws of the universe must ensure that any division between a system's "internal reality" and "external reality" is self-consistent. This is a profound principle regarding "perspective invariance." It demands that, regardless of which state of motion we choose as the "internal" reference frame, the mathematical laws describing more complex states of motion from this frame must remain formally identical to the laws derived from the most fundamental state.

### **Chapter 2: Core Dynamics - The "Operating System" of the Universe**

This chapter defines the dynamic management rules of the universe. These rules do not appear out of thin air but are logically constrained and derived from the axioms of Chapter 1, particularly Axiom 4.

#### **Theorem 0 (The Metric of Reality)**

*   **Discourse:** As a direct and necessary mathematical corollary of Axiom 4, we prove that the only geometric relationship that can satisfy the "self-consistency of arbitrary partitioning" is the orthogonal Pythagorean relationship, see Appendix C.
*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the metric describing the relationship between an entity's total complexity (total energy E), intrinsic complexity (m₀c²), and extrinsic complexity (pc) must be Euclidean, expressed mathematically as:
    > E² = (m₀c²)² + (pc)²
*   **Significance:** This most central dynamical equation of physics is no longer an axiom in this theory but the first theorem to emerge from a philosophical principle of "self-consistency." It is not a physical stipulation about energy, but a mathematical necessity of how information and reality are self-consistently defined.

#### **Axiom 5 (Computational Resource - Time Share)**
*   **5a (Generation):** The "operating system," in each system cycle, generates a fixed amount of basic computational resource for every grid node, called a **"Time Share"** (L_t), and maintains a vacuum inventory level L_t_∞.
*   **5b (Flow):** The flow of Time Shares follows the most economical principle of local equilibrium: its net flux across the grid is proportional to the gradient of the local inventory.

#### **Axiom 6 (Causal Channel Rate)**
The propagation speed v of any causal channel in the universe (i.e., any local event capable of constructing a causal chain, such as particle movement or force field propagation), and the rate of local time passage ν, are uniquely and jointly determined by the "Time Share" inventory level L_t at their location.
> v(L_t) ∝ L_t
> ν(L_t) ∝ L_t

#### **Axiom 7 (Energy as Resource Consumption)**
The total activity E of an entity (as defined by Theorem 0) manifests macroscopically as its total consumption rate of "Time Shares" L_t. The more complex an entity is (the more violently it moves), the more computational resources it consumes.

### **Chapter 3: The Computational Origin of Quantum Phenomena**

This chapter defines the quantum behaviors that necessarily result from the axioms of Chapters 1 and 2. Quantum phenomena are no longer mysterious but are direct manifestations of the underlying computational rules.

#### **Axiom 8 (Symmetry of Fundamental Rules)**
The underlying computational update rule F that determines particle interactions is itself embedded with profound, discrete, fundamental symmetries, which correspond to macroscopic conservation laws.

#### **Axiom 9 (Force as a Manifestation of Probability)**
What we macroscopically call **"force" is the macroscopic manifestation of the underlying base probability that drives the system to transition to a lower total energy state by exchanging virtual perturbations of the L_t field, in order for particles to satisfy the conservation laws guaranteed by Axiom 8**.

#### **Axiom 10 (Emergence of Randomness)**
The probabilistic nature of any physical process originates from the result of the underlying deterministic computational rule F at a specific moment τ, taking the particle's identity key K and the global random number R(τ) as core input parameters: Outcome = F(a, b, ..., R(τ), conditions). To a macroscopic observer who cannot know R(τ), this deterministic process appears purely random.

#### **Axiom 11 (Wave Function as Probability Description)**
The "wave function ψ" is not a physical entity. It is a statistical description of the probability distribution of where a particle (possessing key K) will appear in the future as it interacts with the global random sequence R(τ). All wave phenomena, such as interference and diffraction, are the statistical patterns formed macroscopically by a large number of independent particles following this probability distribution.

#### **Axiom 12 (Entanglement as Identity Locking)**
*   **Essence:** When two or more particles become entangled, it means their identity keys K have undergone a temporary, partial "locking" or "synchronization," forming a fixed relationship.
*   **Source of Instantaneity:** This correlation is instantaneous because it involves no propagation of information. At the same moment τ, the locked particles are all accessing the same global random number R(τ) and, based on their respective keys K, independently compute perfectly correlated results at their local nodes. This is "local computation under global synchronization," not "spooky action at a distance." For a detailed proof, see Appendix G.
*   **Function:** Entanglement does not transmit causal information. It only synchronizes the results of random events between separated nodes.

#### **Axiom 13 (Decoherence as Identity Diffusion)**
*   **Essence:** An entanglement relationship (identity locking) never disappears; it is only transferred.
*   **Mechanism:** When an entangled particle interacts with an environmental particle, the original, simple A-B identity-locking relationship is redistributed into a much larger, more complex A-B-C... system that includes the environmental particles.
*   **Macroscopic Effect:** To a local observer unable to track the entire environment, the original, simple entanglement correlation appears to have **"vanished" because the information has been diluted into the macroscopic environment. This is decoherence**, and it constitutes the core mechanism for the transition from quantum uncertainty to classical determinism.

### **Chapter 4: The Emergent Macro-Universe**

This chapter describes the macroscopic physical laws that necessarily emerge from the combined action of the aforementioned axioms and theorems, as perceivable by an internal observer.

#### **Theorem 1 (Emergence of Gravity)**
*   **Discourse:** Gravity is not a fundamental force but the **necessary result of resource scheduling by the "operating system."**
*   **Mechanism:** Matter consumes L_t according to Axiom 7, causing a spatial gradient in the L_t field. According to the flow rule of Axiom 5b, this necessarily forms an L_t flow field that follows Gauss's law on a macroscopic scale. This non-uniform L_t field is what we experience as gravity.

#### **Theorem 2 (Emergence of Relativity)**
*   **Discourse:** Special and General Relativity are the necessary "systematic perceptual distortions" produced by the "operating system" to maintain logical self-consistency.
*   **Mechanism:** According to Axiom 6, an observer's local L_t level simultaneously determines the rate of their clock ν and the length of their physical measuring rod Δx_ruler (because the propagation speed v of the forces maintaining the rod's form also depends on L_t). This coordinated change of clocks and rods causes any local observer to necessarily obtain a constant value c when measuring the rate of a causal channel. Once this illusion of the "constancy of the speed of light" is established, the entire framework of relativity becomes a mathematical necessity.

#### **Theorem 3 (The Nature of Dark Energy is the Maintenance Cost of Spacetime Structure)**
*   **Discourse:** Dark energy is the direct macroscopic manifestation of the fundamental activity of the universe's "operating system" continuously generating "Time Shares" L_t (Axiom 5a). Its energy density corresponds to the L_t inventory level in the vacuum background, L_t_∞.

#### **Theorem 4 (Origin of Light, Matter, and Fields)**
*   **Discourse:** Light, matter, and fields are the effects of fundamental relationships on the resource field.
*   **See Also:** Appendix H: A Conception of the Microscopic Computational Structure of Matter and Fields; Appendix I: On the Computational Origin and Ratios of Mass Hierarchy.

#### **Theorem 5 (Emergence of Uncertainty and its Relation to Computational Complexity)**
*   **Discourse:** Starting from the core dynamical law of this theory—**Theorem 0 (E² = (m₀c²)² + (pc)²) **—it is possible to logically and rigorously derive a precise, inverse mathematical relationship between a particle's intrinsic uncertainty (Δx, Δp) and its total computational complexity Γ.
*   **Mechanism:** The emergence of this theorem stems from a computational reconstruction of uncertainty. A particle's base computational resource m₀c² defines its intrinsic momentum uncertainty Δp, while its total computational resource E, by defining its "exploration cycle period," ultimately determines its position uncertainty Δx.
*   **Conclusion:** This relationship is ultimately expressed as:
    > Δx Δp = h / Γ
    where the computational complexity factor Γ is defined as Γ ≡ E / m₀c².
*   **Significance:** This theorem shows that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (when p=0, Γ=1) is a natural corollary of this theory at the lowest computational complexity. More profoundly, it reveals a new physical picture: the higher a particle's computational complexity (i.e., the more vigorous its macroscopic motion), the more its intrinsic "degrees of freedom" for exploration are compressed, and the smaller the volume of its quantum uncertainty becomes. Energy, ultimately, is the "computational bill" paid for uncertainty. (For detailed proof, see Appendix E).

### **Chapter 5: Core Predictions**

*   **Gravity and Light Travel at the Same Speed in the Internal World:** Their speeds are strictly equal and depend on the local gravitational potential.
*   **Origin of G and its Relation to Dark Energy:** G is an emergent coefficient, inversely proportional to the dark energy density.
*   **Topological Origin of Mass:** Particle mass ratios can be calculated from their topological complexity. See Appendix I: On the Computational Origin and Ratios of Mass Hierarchy.
*   **Non-unifiability of Gravity:** Gravity (a second-order resource scheduling) is ontologically different from other forces (first-order probabilistic transitions).
*   **Quantum Computers are Unbuildable:** Quantum processes are random processes; quantum computers cannot be built, but quantum communication is possible.
*   **Intrinsic Randomness of the Universe:** There may exist random fluctuations in the large-scale structure of the universe, originating from quantum decisions in the early universe, that cannot be fully explained by classical theory.

### **Chapter 6: Reflections and Inspirations**

*   **Relationship is the Origin of Our Universe:** From a particle, a brain, a person, to a society, a country, a universe, all are patterns that emerge from the operation and evolution of complex internal and external relationships. Their life cycles may exhibit referential similarities.
*   **Wave Effect:** All existence, due to the principle of probability, exhibits a wave-like effect, which is the result of underlying randomness.
*   **Evolution of Complex Patterns:** The evolution of complex patterns is based on the overall temporal progress of the universe, from quarks, protons, atoms, to life and intelligence.
*   **Relativity of Observation:** Why do we not feel time slowing down in a region of strong gravity? Because the very machine of our thought also slows down in that region.
*   **Black Holes:** A black hole is a complex and slow internal structure within a finite space. It is a "particle," but the formation mechanism of this "particle" differs from that of other particles and requires a deep consideration of its internal form. However, it can be determined that it possesses a complete internal structure, and its internal time flow is extremely slow, yet for an internal observer, its time is unchanged.

#### **Appendix A: Proof of Theorem 1 (Gravity)**

*   **A.1 Introduction:** This appendix aims to elaborate on the derivation process of Theorem 1. We will demonstrate that gravity is not an independent fundamental force, but a necessary geometric consequence of the macroscopic scheduling of the computational resource "Time Share" (L_t), as determined by the core axioms of this theory (specifically, Axioms 5, 6, and 7).
*   **A.2 Step 1: From Resource Consumption to Potential Field Gradient (Axiom 7 -> L_t Gradient)**
    *   **Premise (Axiom 7):** Any entity with a total activity E is a source of consumption for the "Time Share" L_t at its location. This is the fundamental law of interaction between matter and the computational resource field.
    *   **Logical Deduction:** For a macroscopically stationary object (total mass M), its total activity E_total is approximately Mc² according to Theorem 0. Therefore, it must be a massive, continuous center of L_t consumption in its spatial region.
    *   **Conclusion:** This continuous consumption in a specific region necessarily breaks the uniform distribution of the L_t field. To replenish the consumption, resources flow from the surroundings to the center, thus inevitably creating a spatial gradient of L_t around the object. That is, the closer to the object, the lower the L_t inventory level.
*   **A.3 Step 2: From Local Flow Rule to Gauss's Law (Axiom 5b -> Gauss's Law)**
    *   **Premise (Axiom 5b):** The flow of L_t resources follows the most economical principle of local equilibrium. The change in the L_t inventory of a grid node i is driven by local generation, consumption, and the net flux determined by the inventory difference L_t(j) - L_t(i) with all its immediate neighboring nodes j.
    *   **Dynamic Equilibrium:** When a stable mass M exists, the system reaches a dynamic equilibrium: the inflowing L_t flux exactly equals the amount consumed by M. In this state, the L_t inventory level at each node, though spatially non-uniform, no longer changes over time.
    *   **Derivation:** In a state of dynamic equilibrium, the equation of Axiom 5b becomes: local net consumption rate = net influx into the node. This is mathematically the discrete definition of divergence.
    *   **Macroscopic Integration:** When we integrate this equilibrium equation over a macroscopic Gaussian surface S enclosing the mass M, according to the Gauss divergence theorem (in its discrete version), we necessarily obtain: Total L_t flux through surface S = Total consumption rate within surface S (i.e., total mass).
    *   **Conclusion:** We have logically and rigorously derived from first principles (Axiom 5b) that the L_t field must follow Gauss's law on a macroscopic scale.
*   **A.4 Step 3: From Gauss's Law to Gravitational Phenomena (L_t Gradient -> Gravity)**
    *   **Emergence of a 1/r² Field:** For a spherically symmetric mass M, applying the Gauss's law we just derived necessarily leads to the conclusion that the strength of the L_t flow field pointing towards it (which we perceive as gravitational acceleration g) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance (g ∝ M/r²).
    *   **Emergence of a 1/r Potential:** Integrating this 1/r² field yields a potential field (i.e., the change in the L_t inventory level) that is necessarily inversely proportional to the distance (ΔL_t ∝ M/r).
    *   **Emergence of Gravitational Effects:** According to Axiom 6 (ν ∝ L_t and v ∝ L_t), this non-uniform L_t field, necessarily caused by matter's consumption, will directly cause the time passage of any object and information within it to slow down (gravitational time dilation) and its propagation path to be deflected (light bending).
*   **A.5 Proof Summary:** Gravity is not a fundamental force but a necessary geometric consequence determined by the theory's resource management axioms. Its form (Gauss's law) is not an assumption but emerges from the most economical local flow rule.

#### **Appendix B: Proof of Theorem 2 (Relativity)**

*   **B.1 Introduction:** This appendix aims to prove that the core phenomena of Special and General Relativity are, within this theoretical framework, a "systematic perceptual distortion" that any observer composed of internal particles must experience when measuring the universe.
*   **B.2 Part 1: Emergence of General Relativity**
    This part has already been completed in Appendix A. The effects of General Relativity that we perceive (spacetime curvature) are a direct manifestation of the non-uniform distribution of the L_t field around matter.
*   **B.3 Part 2: Emergence of Special Relativity - The Construction of the "Constant Speed of Light" Illusion**
    *   **Core Question:** Why does any internal observer, when locally measuring the upper limit of the propagation rate of a causal channel, obtain a constant value c?
    *   **B.3.1 The Co-varying Clock (ν ∝ L_t)**
        *   **Premise (Axiom 6):** An observer's clock is, in essence, a physical device made of particles. Its physical "tick" rate ν is proportional to the local L_t inventory level.
        *   **Conclusion:** When an observer enters a region with lower L_t (for example, by consuming more L_t due to high-speed motion, or by entering a strong gravitational field), their clock physically runs slower. This is the first cornerstone of the proof.
    *   **B.3.2 The Co-varying Measuring Rod (Δx_ruler ∝ L_t)**
        *   **Premise:** Any physical measuring rod (ruler) is a stable structure composed of fundamental particles. Its macroscopic length Δx_ruler is an accumulation of the microscopic **equilibrium distance r_eq** between particles.
        *   **Range of Force:** r_eq is determined by the balance point of the fundamental forces (attraction and repulsion) that maintain the structure of matter. The characteristic range of these forces, R, must be proportional to the propagation speed v of the messenger particles that mediate their interaction.
        *   **Connection to L_t:** According to Axiom 6 (v ∝ L_t), we deduce that R ∝ L_t, and therefore r_eq ∝ L_t.
        *   **Conclusion:** The physical length of a macroscopic ruler, Δx_ruler, must also be proportional to the local L_t. When an observer enters a region with lower L_t, the ruler in their hand physically contracts synchronously and proportionally. This is the second cornerstone of the proof.
    *   **B.3.3 The Emergent Measurement Result**
        *   **Measurement Process:** The observer defines the local speed by measuring the time it takes for a beam of information (like light) to travel one unit of length on their ruler.
        *   **Calculation:** The physical length of the ruler they use is Δx_local ∝ L_t. The absolute time (from a "God's-eye view") required for information to cross this ruler is Δt_god = Δx_local / v(L_t) ∝ L_t / L_t = const. However, the observer records this with their own clock, which has a rate of ν(L_t) ∝ L_t. Therefore, the time reading they measure is Δt_measured = Δt_god * ν(L_t) ∝ const * L_t. Finally, the local speed they calculate is: c_measured = Δx_local / Δt_measured ∝ L_t / (const * L_t) = const.
*   **B.4 Proof Summary:** The "constancy of the speed of light" is not a hardware law of the universe but an emergent "systematic illusion" caused by the perfect, coordinated changes of underlying physical processes, one that is impossible for any internal observer to debunk. Once the "constancy of the speed of light" is established as an iron law in the world of the internal observer, then to maintain this law between different inertial frames, all the familiar effects of Special Relativity (Lorentz transformations, mass-energy equivalence, etc.) become mathematical necessities.

#### **Appendix C: Proof of Theorem 0 (The Metric of Reality)**

*   **C.1 Introduction: From Philosophical Principle to Mathematical Form**
    This appendix aims to prove how Axiom 4 (Principle of Relative Reality Definition)—a purely philosophical requirement about "perspective self-consistency"—necessarily and uniquely leads to the most central dynamical relationship in physics, namely Theorem 0 (E² = (m₀c²)² + (pc)²). We will show that this Pythagorean form is not an arbitrary rule of the universe but a necessary requirement of logic and self-consistency.
*   **C.2 Core Argument: The Orthogonality of Intrinsic and Extrinsic**
    *   **Defining "Reality Space":** We construct an abstract mathematical space to describe the total reality (or total computational complexity) of a particle. In this space, there exist at least two fundamental dimensions:
        *   **Intrinsic Reality Axis:** Represents the irreducible complexity of the particle existing as itself. Its most fundamental unit of measure is m₀c².
        *   **Extrinsic Reality Axis:** Represents the additional complexity generated by the particle's relative motion with respect to the rest of the universe. Its most fundamental unit of measure is pc.
    *   **Deriving Orthogonality:** Axiom 4 requires that the descriptive law must remain invariant, no matter how we redefine the boundary between "internal" and "external." This imposes an extremely strict requirement geometrically: these two dimensions must be orthogonal.
    *   **Thought Experiment:** Assume they are not orthogonal. Then, adding a small component along the "extrinsic reality" axis (i.e., making the particle move slightly) would change its projection value on the "intrinsic reality" axis. This would mean that "motion" itself changes the definition of "identity." If we were to try to absorb this state of motion into a new, stable "internal" reference frame, that frame itself would become inconsistent by its very definition. This violates Axiom 4.
    *   **Therefore,** to ensure that any state of motion can be stably and self-consistently defined as a new "internal baseline," the intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions must be completely independent. In geometry, complete independence means orthogonality.
*   **C.3 Conclusion: The Uniqueness of the Pythagorean Form**
    *   **Euclidean Metric:** Once we establish that the fundamental dimensions of reality space are mutually orthogonal, this space must be a Euclidean space (or its higher-dimensional generalization).
    *   **Calculating Length:** In a Euclidean space of any dimension, the unique, universal method for calculating the total length of a vector (i.e., the distance from the origin to a point in space) is the Pythagorean theorem.
    *   **Emergence of Theorem 0:** Applying this theorem to our "reality space," we necessarily get: [Total Reality]² = [Intrinsic Reality]² + [Extrinsic Reality]². Substituting the physical quantities, this is: E² = (m₀c²)² + (pc)².
*   **C.4 Proof Summary:** Theorem 0 is not a physical law to be memorized but originates from a deeper philosophical belief that "any self-consistent description of reality must be possible." The universe follows this elegant quadratic relationship because it is the only mathematical structure that allows relative concepts like "internal" and "external," "identity" and "motion," to be self-consistently and non-contradictorily defined by us internal observers.

#### **Appendix D: Classical Derivation of Relativistic Mass and the Computational Complexity Factor**

*   **D.1 Introduction**
    This appendix aims to demonstrate an alternative derivation of the computational complexity factor Γ through a conceptual mathematical deduction. The argument shows that if "the computational equivalence of energy and inertia" is introduced into a classical dynamics framework, then the relativistic mass m(V) must take the form m(V) = m₀ * Γ. This derivation serves as an auxiliary proof, showcasing the internal consistency of this theory with classical mechanics from a different perspective.
*   **D.2 Premises and Assumptions**
    1.  F = dp/dt (Force is the rate of change of momentum)
    2.  p = mV (Momentum is the product of total mass and velocity)
    3.  dm = dE_k / c² (The increment in total mass is equivalent to the increment in kinetic energy)
    4.  dE_k = F · dx (The increment in kinetic energy is equal to the work done)
    5.  m(0) = m₀ (Boundary condition)
*   **D.3 Proof Process**
    1.  Combining premises 1 and 4 gives dE_k = V · dp.
    2.  Combining with premise 3 gives c² dm = V · dp.
    3.  Substituting premise 2 into dp = d(mV) and expanding gives c² dm = V · (V dm + m dV).
    4.  Rearranging the differential equation: (c² - V²) dm = mV dV.
    5.  Separating variables and integrating: ∫ (1/m) dm = ∫ (V / (c² - V²)) dV.
    6.  Solving the integral yields ln|m| = -1/2 * ln(c² - V²) + K, which can be written as ln|m| = ln( 1/√(c² - V²) ) + C.
    7.  Exponentiating and applying the boundary condition m(0) = m₀ to solve for the integration constant yields: m(V) = m₀ / √(1 - V²/c²)
*   **D.4 Conclusion:**
    We can see that the classically derived relativistic mass m(V) is precisely the rest mass m₀ multiplied by a factor. We identify this dimensionless growth factor, produced purely by motion, as the computational complexity factor Γ. This derivation, from a different path, verifies the universality of the form Γ = 1 / √(1 - V²/c²) = E / m₀c².

#### **Appendix E: Proof of Theorem 5 (Uncertainty)**

*   **E.1 Introduction:**
    This appendix aims to, starting from Theorem 0 (E² = (m₀c²)² + (pc)²), on the absolute computational grid (a God's-eye view) and in a non-circular manner, directly derive the precise mathematical expression for the relationship between a particle's intrinsic uncertainty (Δx, Δp) and its total computational complexity Γ, which is Theorem 5. The core of this proof lies in avoiding any direct reference to existing conclusions from quantum mechanics, instead building a complete logical chain from the axioms and definitions of this theory itself.
*   **E.2 Foundational Definitions and First Principles**
    To ensure the logical self-consistency of the proof, we first assign purely computational definitions, derived from this theory, to the key physical quantities involved.
    *   **Definition of Momentum Uncertainty Δp:** In a particle's total computational resources, its base resource m₀c² is the portion used to maintain its most fundamental "internal exploration." This internal exploration process must possess an intrinsic momentum scale. In our theoretical system, m₀c is the unique, intrinsic scale with the dimension of momentum assigned by the system to a stationary particle. Therefore, we define, from first principles, the momentum range of a particle's internal exploration Δp as:
        > Δp ≡ m₀c
    *   **Computational Definition of Planck's Constant h:** In this theory, Planck's constant h is no longer merely an empirical constant; it has a fundamental computational meaning. It is defined as the **"Quantum of Computational Action." Its physical significance is: the total amount of computation that an "effective computational unit" (a particle) must execute to complete one most basic "exploration cycle" that maintains its self-consistent identity**. Its units (energy × time) perfectly correspond to the physical picture of (computation rate × computation period).
*   **E.3 Derivation Process**
    1.  **Deriving the Exploration Cycle Period T:**
        *   According to the computational definition of h, the total amount of computation for one self-consistent exploration cycle is h.
        *   According to Axiom 7 (Energy as Resource Consumption), the computational resource allocated by the system to a particle with total energy E (i.e., its computational capacity or rate) is E.
        *   The time required to complete a process is equal to the total work divided by the work rate. Therefore, the absolute time T required for a particle to complete one exploration cycle must be:
            > T = (Total Computation) / (Computation Rate) = h / E
        *   This relationship is derived within this theory, not assumed.
    2.  **Deriving Position Uncertainty Δx:**
        *   A particle's "position uncertainty" Δx is naturally defined as the maximum spatial range its exploration "tentacles" can extend within one complete exploration cycle period T.
        *   According to Axiom 6 (Causal Channel Rate), the propagation of information on the grid (i.e., the extension of exploration tentacles) is limited by the maximum rate of the causal channel, c (simplified as a constant on the absolute grid).
        *   Therefore, the distance that can be traveled at speed c in time T is Δx:
            > Δx ≡ c * T = c * (h / E) = hc / E
    3.  **Unification and Conclusion:**
        Now, we multiply the expressions for Δp and Δx, which were independently derived from first principles:
        > Δx * Δp = (hc/E) * (m₀c) = h * (m₀c²/E)
    4.  **Introducing the Computational Complexity Factor Γ:**
        To more clearly reveal its physical meaning, we introduce the computational complexity factor Γ, identified in Appendix D. This dimensionless factor is defined as the ratio of a particle's total computational resource E to its base computational resource m₀c²: Γ ≡ E / m₀c². It perfectly quantifies the increased computational complexity of the particle due to motion.
    5.  **Final Form:**
        Substituting the definition of Γ into our product, we obtain the final mathematical expression of Theorem 5:
        > Δx Δp = h / Γ
        Using Theorem 0, E = √((m₀c²)² + (pc)²), and Γ = E/m₀c², we can also write it in a form directly related to the kinetic computational resource p:
        > Δx Δp = h / √(1 + (p/m₀c)²)
*   **E.4 Proof Summary:**
    This proof, by endowing Planck's constant h with a purely computational meaning, logically and rigorously derives the precise mathematical form of quantum uncertainty from within the theory's axiomatic system. It profoundly reveals the inverse relationship between uncertainty and computational complexity. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (when p=0, Δx Δp = h) is consolidated as a natural corollary of this theory at its lowest computational complexity.

#### **Appendix F: The Ontological Unification of the Gravitational Constant G and the Cosmological Constant Λ**

*   **F.1 Introduction: From Emergent Parameters to Ontological Unification**
    This appendix aims to derive the intrinsic quantitative relationship between Newton's gravitational constant G and the cosmological constant Λ, the manifestation of dark energy, from the first principles of "Computational Realism." We will go beyond a mere mathematical derivation and delve into the ontological level to prove that G and Λ are not independent constants of nature, but are locked, necessary manifestations of the same underlying physical reality—the vacuum background computational resource level L_t_∞—on two different physical planes.
*   **F.2 Step 1: Theoretical Reconstruction of the Gravitational Constant G**
    Following the derivation of Theorem 1, we express the gravitational constant G as a combination of more fundamental parameters in the theory. The core logical chain is as follows:
    1.  The energy of matter, Mc², consumes the computational resource L_t with an efficiency proportional to a coefficient γ.
    2.  The consumption of L_t creates a gradient ∇L_t in space, and its flow is determined by a conductivity coefficient D.
    3.  The gradient of L_t causes an internal observer to experience gravitational effects like time dilation.
    4.  By calibrating the mathematical form of this effect with the experimentally verified results of General Relativity, t_local/t_far ≈ 1 - GM/rc², we derive the theoretical expression for G:
        > G = (γc⁴) / (4πD * L_t_∞)  (Equation F.1)
    This formula reveals the emergent nature of G and clearly indicates that G is strictly inversely proportional to the vacuum background resource level L_t_∞:
    > G ∝ 1 / L_t_∞ (Relation F.2)
*   **F.3 Step 2: Theoretical Reconstruction of the Cosmological Constant Λ**
    We now turn to the theoretical reconstruction of the cosmological constant Λ from standard cosmology (the ΛCDM model).
    *   **Physical Meaning of Λ:** In the Friedmann equation describing cosmic expansion, H² = (8πG/3)ρ + (Λc²/3) - ..., the Λ term represents the intrinsic energy density of space itself, which does not change with matter density ρ. It is this term that dominates the accelerated expansion of the universe.
    *   **Theoretical Correspondence of Λ:** In the framework of "Computational Realism," this physical meaning corresponds perfectly with the **vacuum background resource level L_t_∞**.
        *   Axiom 5a stipulates a fundamental, continuous generation of the L_t field throughout the cosmic grid.
        *   This continuous generation ensures that the vacuum is not "empty," giving it a baseline resource inventory level L_t_∞.
        *   A non-zero L_t_∞ implies that space itself possesses a "computational pressure" or "background energy," which must manifest macroscopically and geometrically as an intrinsic tendency for space to expand.
    *   Therefore, we make a direct and profound physical correspondence: the cosmological constant Λ in the Standard Model is, in its physical essence, the macroscopic manifestation of the vacuum background resource level L_t_∞ in this theory.
        > Λ ∝ L_t_∞ (Relation F.3)
    This relationship perfectly explains why Λ is a "constant" independent of matter distribution—because it originates from the underlying setting of space itself by the universe's "operating system."
*   **F.4 Step 3: Deriving the Final Relationship between G and Λ**
    We now combine the two core deductions above (Relation F.2 and Relation F.3).
    1.  From the derivation of G, we have L_t_∞ ∝ 1/G.
    2.  From the interpretation of Λ, we have Λ ∝ L_t_∞.
    3.  Combining the two, we eliminate the theory's internal parameter L_t_∞ and obtain an unassailable intrinsic relationship between the two observable macroscopic constants G and Λ:
        > G ∝ 1 / Λ
        Or, written in a more precise form:
        > G * Λ = C_universe (Equation F.4)
    where C_universe is a deeper, universal constant in this theory, composed of parameters like γ, D, etc.
*   **F.5 Conclusion: From Independent Constants to Ontological Unification**
    The final mathematical form of this derivation, G ∝ 1/Λ, is far more significant than a simple proportional relationship. It reveals a profound ontological conclusion: G and Λ are not two interacting, causally related independent entities. They are simultaneous, locked manifestations of the same fundamental property of the universe—the vacuum background computational resource level L_t_∞—on two different physical planes. The correct ontological picture is:
    *   **The One Reality:** The universe's "operating system" sets a single, fundamental parameter L_t_∞. This parameter represents the computational resource abundance of the vacuum itself. It is the "cause."
    *   **The Two Manifestations:** This single "cause" simultaneously produces two "effects":
        1.  On the cosmological macro-geometric level, L_t_∞ manifests as an intrinsic "background pressure" that drives expansion, the magnitude of which is measured by the cosmological constant Λ. Thus, Λ is a direct, proportional measure of L_t_∞.
        2.  On the level of matter-spacetime interaction, this "resource background" L_t_∞ determines the "response efficiency" of the geometric effect that matter (energy) can induce when consuming resources. A more abundant resource background (a larger L_t_∞) would "dilute" or "weaken" the relative perturbation a unit of matter can cause. The magnitude of this weakened response efficiency is measured by the gravitational constant G. Thus, G is an inverse measure of L_t_∞.
    Therefore, the inverse relationship between G and Λ is not due to a physical interaction between them, but because they share the same "parent" (L_t_∞), with one inheriting the "positive image" and the other inheriting the "negative image."

#### **Appendix G: The Computational Origin of Entanglement - Deterministic Synchronization of Intrinsic Patterns**

*   **G.1 Introduction: Beyond Classical Intuition**
    This appendix aims to provide a clear, self-consistent, and operational computational model for one of the most central and counter-intuitive phenomena in this theory—quantum entanglement. We will prove that entanglement is not a mysterious "spooky action at a distance," but a profound **"information imprinting" mechanism**. It does not violate the universe's random foundation but, in a deterministic way, forces the synchronization of the behavior of multiple independent entities when they face randomness. This proof will be strictly based on the theory's axiomatic system, particularly Axiom 0 (Global Randomness Field) and Axiom 3 (Computational Rules and Units).
*   **G.2 Theoretical Foundation: Re-examining Key Axioms**
    *   **Global Random Source R(τ) (Axiom 0):** At every absolute time step τ, the universe provides a globally shared, unpredictable random value R(τ). This is the sole source of all fundamental quantum randomness.
    *   **Intrinsic Pattern K (Axiom 3):** Each particle possesses a complex intrinsic pattern (or identity key) K. We will focus on its spin-related part—a hidden, deterministic intrinsic vector S.
    *   **Measurement as Context-Dependent Computation:** Measurement is not a passive "reading" process but an active computational process. Its result is determined by a deterministic function F, whose inputs include the particle's intrinsic pattern K (containing vector S), the state of the measuring apparatus K_det (defined by the measurement angle a), and the global random number R(τ).
*   **G.3 The Computational Definition of Entanglement: A One-Time "Vector Burn-in"**
    *   **The Essence of an Entanglement Event:** Entanglement is a one-time "vector burn-in" event. When a source produces a pair of entangled particles, A and B, it performs a special "programming" operation.
    *   **Choice of a Random Axis:** The entanglement source will first (possibly randomly) select an absolute axis in space, for example, the Z-axis.
    *   **Imprinting of the Intrinsic Vectors:** It then permanently and deterministically imprints the intrinsic spin vectors of the two particles, S_A and S_B, onto this chosen axis, making their directions perfectly anti-correlated.
    *   **Post-Entanglement State:** Particle A's intrinsic pattern K_A' now contains a fixed spin vector S_A = +Z. Particle B's intrinsic pattern K_B' also contains a fixed spin vector S_B = -Z.
    *   **The True Meaning of a "Fixed Result":** What is "fixed" or "imprinted" at the moment of entanglement is not the future measurement readings of the individual particles, but their respective intrinsic, hidden, yet perfectly anti-correlated vector directions S.
*   **G.4 Emergence of Instantaneous Correlation: Local Computation under Global Randomness**
    *   **Localized Computation:** Alice, at time τ, measures particle A at angle a, performing the computation: Outcome_A = F(S_A, a, R(τ)). Bob, at the same instant τ, measures particle B at angle b, performing the computation: Outcome_B = F(S_B, b, R(τ)).
    *   **Two Sources of Correlation:**
        1.  **Deterministic Source (Intrinsic Vector):** Since S_A = -S_B, the first input parameter to the computation function is perfectly anti-correlated.
        2.  **Random Source (Global Synchronization):** Since they measure at the same instant τ, the third input parameter they use, R(τ), is absolutely identical.
    *   **Source of Instantaneity:** The correlation is instantaneous because it does not depend on any signal propagating between A and B. It arises from two independent local computations that use two pre-synchronized inputs: (1) the intrinsic vector S, synchronized at the moment of entanglement, and (2) the random number R(τ), synchronized at the moment of measurement by the universe's global clock.
*   **G.5 Conclusion: A Response to Bell's Inequality**
    This theoretical model belongs to a class known as **"contextual, non-local hidden-variable theories."**
    *   **Hidden Variable:** There exists a "hidden variable," namely the particle's intrinsic, deterministic vector S, and the global random number R(τ).
    *   **Contextual:** The measurement outcome depends not only on the hidden variable S but also on the **"context"** of the measurement, i.e., the setting angle a of the measuring apparatus.
    *   **Non-locality:** The non-locality of the theory is embodied in Axiom 0 itself—the existence of that globally shared, instantaneously synchronized R(τ).

#### **Appendix H: A Conception of the Microscopic Computational Structure of Matter and Fields**

This appendix aims to provide a conceptual, logically self-consistent computational structure model for the hierarchy of forces, the electromagnetic field, the photon, and fundamental particles (electrons, protons), based on the first principles of "Computational Realism."

*   **H.1 The Ontological Hierarchy of Forces: The Second-Order Nature of Gravity**
    *   **Gravity: A Fundamentally "Second-Order" Reality**
        *   **Level of Action:** System-level / Architecture-level. Gravity is the manifestation of the macroscopic scheduling law for the universe's computational resources.
        *   **Causal Chain:** Particle A consumes L_t resource -> The L_t field develops a gradient -> Particle B responds to this altered background field.
        *   **Physical Picture:** Gravity is not particle A acting directly on particle B, but an indirect influence by changing the computational "stage" they both share.
    *   **Electromagnetic and Nuclear Forces: Fundamentally "First-Order" Realities**
        *   **Level of Action:** Application-level / Protocol-level. These forces are the direct execution of the underlying computational rule F on the basic attributes of particles.
        *   **Causal Chain:** The attributes K_A of particle A, via rule F, directly produce a computational effect on particle B.
        *   **Physical Picture:** This is a "point-to-point" interaction, handled by a fixed "communication protocol."
*   **H.2 The Electromagnetic Field: A Static "Computational Stress" Field**
    *   **H.2.1 Electric Field (E-Field):** The radial gradient part of the "computational stress." A static vector field rendered in the surrounding nodes by an electric charge (a "source/sink" marker).
    *   **H.2.2 Magnetic Field (B-Field):** The curl part of the "computational stress." A static "vortex"-like stress field rendered by spin (an intrinsic "direction of circulation").
*   **H.3 The Photon: A Dynamic "Energy Wave Packet"**
    A photon is a self-consistent, self-propagating energy wave packet composed of orthogonal "computational stresses." It is a real particle that is "decoupled" and propagates when the static stress field around an accelerating charged particle changes.
*   **H.4 Global Interaction of Electrons and Protons**
    They follow the "first-order" electromagnetic field rules. Each renders a "computational stress field" and moves in the direction that lowers the total "computational stress" of the system, according to rule F.
*   **H.5 Internal Computational Structure of Electrons and Protons**
    *   **H.5.1 Internal Structure of the Electron (K_e): The Minimum Stable Pattern**
        *   **Essence:** The simplest topologically self-consistent computational loop, possessing intrinsic chirality and phase.
        *   **Origin of Mass (m_e):** The structural complexity of the "topologically self-consistent loop."
        *   **Origin of Charge (-e):** The inherent "chirality" or "asymmetry" of the loop pattern.
        *   **Origin of Spin (s):** The projection in three-dimensional space of the intrinsic, periodic "phase" of the loop process.
    *   **H.5.2 Internal Structure of the Proton (K_P): A Second-Order Stable Pattern**
        *   **Essence:** A dynamically stable composite pattern of "three-body shared computation," composed of three "incomplete patterns" (quarks).
        *   **Quarks as "Incomplete Patterns":** Possess "open computational interfaces" (color charge) that cannot self-neutralize.
        *   **Origin of Proton Stability:** The "open interfaces" of the u-u-d quark patterns form a closed "grand loop of shared computation," which is "color-neutral" externally.
        *   **Origin of Proton Charge (+e):** The net algebraic sum of the "asymmetries" of the three internal quark patterns: (+2/3) + (+2/3) + (-1/3) = +1.

#### **Appendix I: On the Computational Origin and Ratios of Mass Hierarchy**

*   **I.1 Introduction: From Empirical Parameters to Necessary Constants**
    This appendix aims to argue that the mass of particles and their ratios are no longer externally input empirical parameters, but are constants that emerge necessarily from the universe's underlying computational rules and geometric constraints, and are, in principle, calculable.
*   **I.2 Core Principle: Mass as a Measure of Topological Complexity**
    1.  **Particle as Pattern:** Each particle is a stable computational pattern defined by its key K.
    2.  **Mass as Cost:** Rest mass m₀ is the base L_t consumption rate required to maintain the stability of pattern K.
    3.  **Cost is Proportional to Complexity:** The consumption rate is proportional to the pattern's topological complexity number C_T. (m ∝ C_T)
    4.  **Mass Ratio as Complexity Ratio:** m_A / m_B = C_T(K_A) / C_T(K_B).
*   **I.3 Structural Conception (1): Particle Generations as "Computational Dimensions"**
    We conceive of particle "generations" as corresponding to the "computational dimension" (D) in which their stable pattern is embedded.
    *   **First Generation (D=1):** A one-dimensional "linear" computational loop, lowest complexity.
    *   **Second Generation (D=2):** A two-dimensional "surface-like" loop, with a non-linear leap in computational cost.
    *   **Third Generation (D=3):** A three-dimensional "volume-like" loop, with an exponential leap in computational cost.
*   **I.4 Quantitative Computational Model and Principal Validation**
    *   **Hypothesis I.1 (Mathematical Form of Complexity):** C_T ≈ β * α^D
        *   **α:** Dimensional transition factor, conjectured to be α ≈ 2π.
        *   **β:** Base form factor (e.g., quark's "open-string" pattern β_O vs. lepton's "closed-string" pattern β_C).
    *   **Applying the Model to Calculate the m_s / m_d Mass Ratio:**
        *   **Down Quark (d):** D=1, "open-string", C_T(d) = β_O(1D) * α
        *   **Strange Quark (s):** D=2, "open-string", C_T(s) = β_O(2D) * α²
        *   **Calculating the Ratio:** m_s / m_d = (β_O(2D) / β_O(1D)) * α
    *   **Principal Validation:**
        *   Experimental value m_s / m_d ≈ 19.
        *   Substituting α ≈ 2π ≈ 6.28, this requires the form complexity ratio β_O(2D) / β_O(1D) ≈ 19 / 6.28 ≈ 3.02.
        *   This ratio of ≈3 is plausible, suggesting that elevating a 1D pattern to a 2D pattern triples the base structural complexity.
        *   **Computational Reproduction:** m_s / m_d ≈ 3 * 2π ≈ 18.85, which is surprisingly consistent with the experimental value.
*   **I.5 Inferences and Outlook of the Model**
    This model reveals that mass ratios are locked by geometric and topological constants and provides a testable predictive path, for example:
    *   **Muon/Electron Mass Ratio:** m_μ / m_e = (β_C(2D) / β_C(1D)) * α. The experimental value is ≈207, requiring a "closed-string" form complexity ratio of β_C(2D) / β_C(1D) ≈ 33.
    *   **Bottom/Strange Quark Mass Ratio:** m_b / m_s = (β_O(3D) / β_O(2D)) * α. The experimental value is ≈44, requiring an "open-string" form complexity ratio from 2D to 3D of β_O(3D) / β_O(2D) ≈ 7.
    **Final Conclusion:** The mystery of mass, in this theory, ultimately reduces to an ultimate challenge concerning the "dimension and form of stable computational patterns."
